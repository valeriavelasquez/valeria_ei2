After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 254 -> 254
    -- Scaled 0 precincts, for an increase of 0 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'BVAP', 'HVAP', 'ASIANVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Annissa George', 'Andrea Campbell', 'Kim Janey', 'Michelle Wu', 'None'] EI on BMAY21P
r = 5 rows (demographic groups)
c = 5 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 254
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 5_000 tune and 5_000 draw iterations (20_000 + 20_000 draws total) took 13932 seconds.
The chain reached the maximum tree depth. Increase max_treedepth, increase target_accept or reparameterize.
The chain reached the maximum tree depth. Increase max_treedepth, increase target_accept or reparameterize.
The rhat statistic is larger than 1.05 for some parameters. This indicates slight problems during sampling.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
