Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [b, conc_params]
 -- Processing COMP14
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 110 -> 110
    -- Scaled 1 precincts, for an increase of 36 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'BVAP', 'HVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Peter Franchot', 'William Campbell', 'None'] EI on COMP14
r = 4 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 110
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 690 seconds.
The rhat statistic is larger than 1.05 for some parameters. This indicates slight problems during sampling.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
