Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [b, conc_params]
 -- Processing TRE18
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 7002 -> 6695
    -- Scaled 33 precincts, for an increase of 1678 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'BVAP', 'HVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Sarah Godlewski', 'Travis Hartwig', 'None'] EI on TRE18
r = 4 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 6695
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 137761 seconds.
There were 2 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 2 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 2 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 7 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The rhat statistic is larger than 1.05 for some parameters. This indicates slight problems during sampling.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
