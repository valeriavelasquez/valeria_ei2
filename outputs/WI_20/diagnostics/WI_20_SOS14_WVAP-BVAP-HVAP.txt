Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [b, conc_params]
 -- Processing SOS14
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 7002 -> 6695
    -- Scaled 38 precincts, for an increase of 1830 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'BVAP', 'HVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Doug LaFollette', 'Julian Bradley', 'None'] EI on SOS14
r = 4 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 6695
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 147860 seconds.
The rhat statistic is larger than 1.4 for some parameters. The sampler did not converge.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
