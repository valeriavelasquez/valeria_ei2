Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [b, conc_params]
 -- Processing PRES20
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 7002 -> 6695
    -- Scaled 172 precincts, for an increase of 9055 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'BVAP', 'HVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Joe Biden', 'Donald Trump', 'None'] EI on PRES20
r = 4 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 6695
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 69950 seconds.
There were 997 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The acceptance probability does not match the target. It is 0.9706043508039871, but should be close to 0.99. Try to increase the number of tuning steps.
There were 986 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 990 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The acceptance probability does not match the target. It is 0.9640667139948452, but should be close to 0.99. Try to increase the number of tuning steps.
There were 982 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The rhat statistic is larger than 1.4 for some parameters. The sampler did not converge.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
