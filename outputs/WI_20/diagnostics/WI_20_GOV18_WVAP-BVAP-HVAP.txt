â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 148641 seconds.
There were 20 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 45 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 22 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 61 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The rhat statistic is larger than 1.05 for some parameters. This indicates slight problems during sampling.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
