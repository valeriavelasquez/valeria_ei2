 -- Processing COMP18
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 230 -> 230
    -- Scaled 6 precincts, for an increase of 2176 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Peter Franchot', 'Anjali Phukan', 'None'] EI on COMP18
r = 2 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 230
