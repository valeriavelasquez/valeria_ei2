 -- Processing AG18
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 230 -> 230
    -- Scaled 6 precincts, for an increase of 2233 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Brian Frosh', 'Craig Wolf', 'None'] EI on AG18
r = 2 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 230
