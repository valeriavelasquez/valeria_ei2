Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [b, conc_params]
 -- Processing PRES16
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 1809 -> 1802
    -- Scaled 10 precincts, for an increase of 2948 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Hillary Clinton', 'Donald Trump', 'None'] EI on PRES16
r = 2 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 1802
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 10404 seconds.
The chain reached the maximum tree depth. Increase max_treedepth, increase target_accept or reparameterize.

The chain reached the maximum tree depth. Increase max_treedepth, increase target_accept or reparameterize.
The rhat statistic is larger than 1.05 for some parameters. This indicates slight problems during sampling.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
