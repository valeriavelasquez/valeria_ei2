Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [b, conc_params]
 -- Processing AG18
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 1809 -> 1802
    -- Scaled 5 precincts, for an increase of 1658 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'BVAP', 'HVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Brian Frosh', 'Craig Wolf', 'None'] EI on AG18
r = 4 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 1802
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 74953 seconds.
The chain reached the maximum tree depth. Increase max_treedepth, increase target_accept or reparameterize.
The rhat statistic is larger than 1.4 for some parameters. The sampler did not converge.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
