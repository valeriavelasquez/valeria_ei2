Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [b, conc_params]
 -- Processing SEN16
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 166 -> 166
    -- Scaled 16 precincts, for an increase of 7277 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Chris Van Hollen', 'Kathy Szeliga', 'None'] EI on SEN16
r = 2 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 166
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 1147 seconds.
There were 520 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The chain reached the maximum tree depth. Increase max_treedepth, increase target_accept or reparameterize.
There were 614 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 614 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 600 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
