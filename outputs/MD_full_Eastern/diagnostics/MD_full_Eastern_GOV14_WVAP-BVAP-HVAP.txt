â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 1940 seconds.
There were 67 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 69 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 51 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 144 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The rhat statistic is larger than 1.05 for some parameters. This indicates slight problems during sampling.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
