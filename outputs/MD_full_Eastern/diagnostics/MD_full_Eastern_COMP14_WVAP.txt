Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [b, conc_params]
 -- Processing COMP14
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 166 -> 166
    -- Scaled 6 precincts, for an increase of 2148 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Peter Franchot', 'William Campbell', 'None'] EI on COMP14
r = 2 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 166
█Sampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 1794 seconds.
There was 1 divergence after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The chain reached the maximum tree depth. Increase max_treedepth, increase target_accept or reparameterize.
There were 6 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The chain reached the maximum tree depth. Increase max_treedepth, increase target_accept or reparameterize.
There were 7 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
