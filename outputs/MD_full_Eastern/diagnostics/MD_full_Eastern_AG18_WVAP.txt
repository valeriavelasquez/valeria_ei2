Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [b, conc_params]
 -- Processing AG18
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 166 -> 166
    -- Scaled 11 precincts, for an increase of 4246 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Brian Frosh', 'Craig Wolf', 'None'] EI on AG18
r = 2 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 166
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 1522 seconds.
There were 209 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 184 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 287 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 166 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
