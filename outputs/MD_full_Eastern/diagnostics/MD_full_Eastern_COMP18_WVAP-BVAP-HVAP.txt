Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [b, conc_params]
 -- Processing COMP18
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 166 -> 166
    -- Scaled 10 precincts, for an increase of 4148 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'BVAP', 'HVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Peter Franchot', 'Anjali Phukan', 'None'] EI on COMP18
r = 4 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 166
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 1402 seconds.
There were 564 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
