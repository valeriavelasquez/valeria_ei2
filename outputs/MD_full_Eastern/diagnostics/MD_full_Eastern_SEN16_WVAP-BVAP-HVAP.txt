 -- Processing SEN16
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 166 -> 166
    -- Scaled 16 precincts, for an increase of 7291 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'BVAP', 'HVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Chris Van Hollen', 'Kathy Szeliga', 'None'] EI on SEN16
r = 4 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 166
