Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [b, conc_params]
 -- Processing SEN18
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 166 -> 166
    -- Scaled 10 precincts, for an increase of 3954 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Ben Cardin', 'Tony Campbell', 'None'] EI on SEN18
r = 2 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 166
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 1502 seconds.
There were 206 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 193 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 198 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 197 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The number of effective samples is smaller than 10% for some parameters.
