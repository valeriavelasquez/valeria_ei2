Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [b, conc_params]
 -- Processing PRES12
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 189 -> 189
    -- Scaled 0 precincts, for an increase of 0 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Barack Obama', 'Mitt Romney', 'None'] EI on PRES12
r = 2 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 189
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 945 seconds.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
