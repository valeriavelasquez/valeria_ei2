â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 292 seconds.
The acceptance probability does not match the target. It is 0.970513903175138, but should be close to 0.99. Try to increase the number of tuning steps.
The number of effective samples is smaller than 10% for some parameters.
