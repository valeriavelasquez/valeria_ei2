Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [b, conc_params]
 -- Processing SEN16PD
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 166 -> 166
    -- Scaled 0 precincts, for an increase of 0 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Chris Van Hollen', 'Donna Edwards', 'None'] EI on SEN16PD
r = 2 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 166
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 556 seconds.
The rhat statistic is larger than 1.05 for some parameters. This indicates slight problems during sampling.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
