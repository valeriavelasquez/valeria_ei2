After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 166 -> 166
    -- Scaled 7 precincts, for an increase of 2684 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Chris Van Hollen', 'Kathy Szeliga', 'None'] EI on SEN16
r = 2 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 166
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 1677 seconds.
There was 1 divergence after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
