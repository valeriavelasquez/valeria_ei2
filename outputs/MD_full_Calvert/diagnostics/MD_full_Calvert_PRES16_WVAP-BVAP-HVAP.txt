 -- Processing PRES16
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 23 -> 23
    -- Scaled 1 precincts, for an increase of 71 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'BVAP', 'HVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Hillary Clinton', 'Donald Trump', 'None'] EI on PRES16
r = 4 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 23
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 205 seconds.
There was 1 divergence after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
