Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [b, conc_params]
 -- Processing AG18
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 1809 -> 1802
    -- Scaled 37 precincts, for an increase of 10330 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'BVAP', 'HVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Brian Frosh', 'Craig Wolf', 'None'] EI on AG18
r = 4 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 1802
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 43228 seconds.
There were 853 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The chain reached the maximum tree depth. Increase max_treedepth, increase target_accept or reparameterize.
There were 805 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The acceptance probability does not match the target. It is 0.971682730618489, but should be close to 0.99. Try to increase the number of tuning steps.
The chain reached the maximum tree depth. Increase max_treedepth, increase target_accept or reparameterize.
There were 829 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The chain reached the maximum tree depth. Increase max_treedepth, increase target_accept or reparameterize.
There were 864 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The chain reached the maximum tree depth. Increase max_treedepth, increase target_accept or reparameterize.
The rhat statistic is larger than 1.2 for some parameters.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
