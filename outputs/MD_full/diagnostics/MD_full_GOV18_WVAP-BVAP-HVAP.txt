After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 1809 -> 1802
    -- Scaled 40 precincts, for an increase of 11380 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'BVAP', 'HVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Ben Jealous', 'Larry Hogan', 'None'] EI on GOV18
r = 4 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 1802
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 30709 seconds.
There were 931 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The chain reached the maximum tree depth. Increase max_treedepth, increase target_accept or reparameterize.
There were 947 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.

There were 957 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 994 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The rhat statistic is larger than 1.4 for some parameters. The sampler did not converge.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
