Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [b, conc_params]
 -- Processing SEN18
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 1809 -> 1802
    -- Scaled 31 precincts, for an increase of 8737 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'BVAP', 'HVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Ben Cardin', 'Tony Campbell', 'None'] EI on SEN18
r = 4 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 1802
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 52493 seconds.
There were 712 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The chain reached the maximum tree depth. Increase max_treedepth, increase target_accept or reparameterize.
There were 685 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The chain reached the maximum tree depth. Increase max_treedepth, increase target_accept or reparameterize.
There were 860 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The chain reached the maximum tree depth. Increase max_treedepth, increase target_accept or reparameterize.
There were 698 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The chain reached the maximum tree depth. Increase max_treedepth, increase target_accept or reparameterize.
The rhat statistic is larger than 1.4 for some parameters. The sampler did not converge.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
