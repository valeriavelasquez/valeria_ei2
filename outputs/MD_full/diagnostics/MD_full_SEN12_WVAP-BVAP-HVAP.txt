Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [b, conc_params]
 -- Processing SEN12
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 1809 -> 1802
    -- Scaled 10 precincts, for an increase of 2296 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'BVAP', 'HVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Ben Cardin', 'Dan Bongino', 'None'] EI on SEN12
r = 4 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 1802
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 76074 seconds.
There were 60 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 40 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 34 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 37 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The rhat statistic is larger than 1.05 for some parameters. This indicates slight problems during sampling.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
