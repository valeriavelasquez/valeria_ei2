Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [b, conc_params]
 -- Processing SEN18
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 43 -> 43
    -- Scaled 1 precincts, for an increase of 225 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'BVAP', 'HVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Ben Cardin', 'Tony Campbell', 'None'] EI on SEN18
r = 4 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 43
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 747 seconds.
