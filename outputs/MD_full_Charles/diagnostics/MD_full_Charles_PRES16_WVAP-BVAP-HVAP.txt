Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [b, conc_params]
 -- Processing PRES16
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 43 -> 43
    -- Scaled 4 precincts, for an increase of 842 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'BVAP', 'HVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Hillary Clinton', 'Donald Trump', 'None'] EI on PRES16
r = 4 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 43
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 667 seconds.
There were 106 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 130 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 120 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The chain reached the maximum tree depth. Increase max_treedepth, increase target_accept or reparameterize.
There were 111 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The chain reached the maximum tree depth. Increase max_treedepth, increase target_accept or reparameterize.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
