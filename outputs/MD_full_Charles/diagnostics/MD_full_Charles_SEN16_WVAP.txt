Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [b, conc_params]
 -- Processing SEN16
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 43 -> 43
    -- Scaled 4 precincts, for an increase of 811 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Chris Van Hollen', 'Kathy Szeliga', 'None'] EI on SEN16
r = 2 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 43
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 650 seconds.
There were 6 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 4 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 10 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 2 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
