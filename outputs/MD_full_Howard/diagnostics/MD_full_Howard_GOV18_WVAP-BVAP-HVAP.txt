    -- Scaled 7 precincts, for an increase of 1684 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'BVAP', 'HVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Ben Jealous', 'Larry Hogan', 'None'] EI on GOV18
r = 4 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 110
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 1406 seconds.
There were 171 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 240 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 187 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
There were 184 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The rhat statistic is larger than 1.05 for some parameters. This indicates slight problems during sampling.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
