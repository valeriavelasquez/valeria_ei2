 -- Processing COMP14
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 64 -> 63
    -- Scaled 0 precincts, for an increase of 0 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Peter Franchot', 'William Campbell', 'None'] EI on COMP14
r = 2 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 63
