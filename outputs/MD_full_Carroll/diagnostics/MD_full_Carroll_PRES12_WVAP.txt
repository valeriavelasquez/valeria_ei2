Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [b, conc_params]
 -- Processing PRES12
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 34 -> 34
    -- Scaled 0 precincts, for an increase of 0 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Barack Obama', 'Mitt Romney', 'None'] EI on PRES12
r = 2 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 34
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 139 seconds.
The rhat statistic is larger than 1.05 for some parameters. This indicates slight problems during sampling.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
