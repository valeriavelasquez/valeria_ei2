After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 34 -> 34
    -- Scaled 0 precincts, for an increase of 0 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'BVAP', 'HVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Peter Franchot', 'Anjali Phukan', 'None'] EI on COMP18
r = 4 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 34
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 175 seconds.
