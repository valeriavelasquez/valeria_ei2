Multiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)
NUTS: [b, conc_params]
 -- Processing PRES12
After dropping NA and 0-VAP, len df 36 -> 36
    -- Scaled 0 precincts, for an increase of 0 VAP
Running ['WVAP', 'OVAP'] x ['Barack Obama', 'Mitt Romney', 'None'] EI on PRES12
r = 2 rows (demographic groups)
c = 3 columns (candidates or voting outcomes)
number of precincts = 36
â–ˆSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 160 seconds.
The acceptance probability does not match the target. It is 0.9703045309701089, but should be close to 0.99. Try to increase the number of tuning steps.
The estimated number of effective samples is smaller than 200 for some parameters.
